# Dijkstra-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
This is an implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. The algorithm displays the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph. The algorithm is popular in map services.  If it is implemented using a Fibonacci heap, the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm can be reduced to O(|E|+|V|log|V|).
